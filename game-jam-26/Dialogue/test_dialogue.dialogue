else:

# Can't figure out how to put code inside dialogue without using an if statement, should probably change
# The change_mask method always returns true btw, its so i can call it inside an if statement
if GameState.change_mask(GameState.Masks.DIPLOMAT):
	Mikha: Right, lets change what you're wearing...
